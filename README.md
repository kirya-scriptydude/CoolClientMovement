# CoolClientMovement
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo).

A collection of client-side scripts for more interesting character movement options.

## Getting started
You can compile it like any other rojo project, but I recommend *syncing* it instead. Install Rojo plugin in Roblox Studio, start live-syncing and connect from studio.
